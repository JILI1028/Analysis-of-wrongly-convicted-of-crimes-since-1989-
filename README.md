# Analysis-of-wrongly-convicted-of-crimes-since-1989-
A. Background Researchers in the United States have identified well over 2,000 individuals who were wrongly convicted of crimes that they did not commit since 1989.  We are curious about the compensation of the wrongly convicted. By way of background, there are two basic ways the wrongfully convicted can seek compensation.  First, 33 states have state statutes which permit exonerees to request compensation from a state court or state administrative body.  Second, the wrongly convicted may instead (or also) seek compensation in court for a violation of their civil rights or on various state law tort theories like false imprisonment or malicious prosecution.  Plus, not every exoneree is actually incarcerated and not everyone who is incarcerated seeks compensation. B. Goals This report is to better understand the relationship between important factors, such as race, gender, years lost, etc. and the compensation outcome of the wrongly convicted of crimes. I need to respond to some inquiries from Professor Jeffrey Gutman of the GW Law School, fit multivariate regression and make some predictions of unsolved cases.
