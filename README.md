# Analysis-of-wrongly-convicted-of-crimes-since-1989-
# Procedure:
### 1. Introduction 
# This report is to better understand the relationship between important factors, such as race, gender, years lost, etc. and the compensation outcome of the wrongly convicted of crimes. I need to respond to some inquiries from Professor Jeffrey Gutman of the GW Law School, fit multivariate regression and make some predictions of unsolved cases. 

### 2. Dataset and data pre-processing 
# http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/about.aspx. The dataset contains 1900 exonerees organized alphabetically by the state of conviction. 
# Fix type errors and delete useless variables.

### 3. Some important numbers and likelihood of factors(e.g. Race, Gender, etc.)
# Please refer to the report for details.

### 4. Relationship between factors and compensation outcome 
# Please refer to the report for details.

### 5. Tried Some Methods: Multivariate Regression, Random Forest
# Please refer to the report for details.

### 6. Draw a conclusion 
# If we have more focus on the effect of significant factors such as Race, geographic area, DNA cases, etc., we may reduce these tragic errors in the future.
# it’s simpler to interpret and predict the likelihood of the compensation by using logistic models
# About the amount of compensation, we need plenty of variables and it’s difficult to explain and predict because of lots of randomness by using linear regression models.
# RMSE of predictions in “glm” model is small.
